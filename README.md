## MONSTERS ROLODEX

[Monsters Rolodex](https://github.com/jakeberggren/Udemy-Complete-React-Developer/tree/main/crwn-clothing) is a simple rolodex app which fetches data from a JSON mock server to display cards of different monsters and provides a search function to filter through them. This is the first project in the course, and aims to show the basics of React, React-DOM and how React renders different components on the page.
